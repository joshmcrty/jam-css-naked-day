JAM CSS Naked Day removes CSS from your website on CSS Naked Day, April 9th.

== Description ==

CSS Naked Day takes place on April 9th. The idea is to promote web standards by removing all CSS from your website and leaving just semantic HTML. This plugin removes external style sheets, embedded style sheets, and style attributes from all pages on April 9th. It provides a few options as well to tailor the plugin to your preferences.

Features include:

* A preview mode to allow logged in administrators to view the site as it will appear on CSS Naked Day.
* A local or global timeframe option to determine how long the site will be naked.
* A JavaScript mode and a PHP mode.
* A user-customizable message that can be displayed at the top of the website on CSS Naked Day.

== Installation ==

Upload the JAM CSS Naked Day plugin to your blog, Activate it, then set up your options (or leave the defaults).
